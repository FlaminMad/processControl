Welcome to the world of process control!

Computer control is becoming more and more critical to ensure the smooth
operation of almost all processes. This library contains a handfull of control
algorithms, each of which can be used for a wide range of applications. It has
been written with simplicity in mind so as to ensure it caters for both those 
with little to no knowlegde, and those of whom have a wide range of experience 
in the field.

Potential applications range from simple PID motor control with an arduino to 
fully fledged dynamic matrix control of an industrial rig.
Excuse the pun... but your in control.
